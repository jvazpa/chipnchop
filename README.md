### Troubleshooting

##### ChIPnCHOP doesn't read properly the parameters file

Once you have checked you have specified the correct path to the parameter file, you must ascertain that there are one space between the colon and the parameter. For instance, "working_directory:/home/mickeymouse/tmp/" won't be read properly, whereas "working_directory: /home/anagontor1/tmp/" will.

### Status

ChIPnCHOP has been tested on MacOS Catalina, MacOS Big Sur and Ubuntu 16.04. If you find a bug, please do report it on the GitHub issue tracker. 

### Roadmap

* Make multiple sampling parallelization available.
